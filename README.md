## 🧠 How It Works

1. User visits the site and registers using Firebase.
2. They select symptoms from a simple UI or upload relevant info/images.
3. The system:
   - Uses **Gemini API** for smart advice,
   - Runs inputs through a **TensorFlow model** for predictions,
   - Translates results in real-time using **Weglot API**.
4. Output is shown in the selected language with actionable insights.
